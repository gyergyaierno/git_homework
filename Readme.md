-Challenges: I have spent almost 6 hours just today, starting over the whole homework from the scratch like 4-5 times to somehow finalize it, using google, openai, documentation..I had 4 mental breakdowns trying to figure out why it won't work properly.
 The biggest problem was, that at the beginning I had no idea what to look for to check if the changes were indeed made as planned.  
I am still not sure if everything I've done is correct. 
-New things I learned: - Well, I guess I learned the basic commands and kinda understand the process now.Also found out that we can do the same things I did in bash, in IntelliJ or Visual Studio by having BUTTONS.
-As feedback: It is a personal opinion, but I guess in the beginning it would be helpful to show the very basic stuff to students step by step but otherwise thank you very much for transferring a part of your knowledge to us and sorry for being late with the homework, life is a mess lately...

 it is a version control system aimed to help developers to keep track of changes in the code
